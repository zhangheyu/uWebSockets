#### Tread lightly.
This is the **development branch** of v0.15. Track progress & issues [here](https://github.com/uNetworking/issues/issues). Checkout [v0.14](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets/tree/v0.14) for something stable.

#### Express yourself briefly.
```c++
uWS::SSLApp({

    /* There are tons of SSL options */
    .cert_file_name = "cert.pem",
    .key_file_name = "key.pem"
    
}).get("/hello", [](auto *res, auto *req) {

    /* You can efficiently stream huge files too */
    res->writeHeader("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")->end("Hello HTTP!");
    
}).ws<UserData>("/*", {

    /* Just a few of the available handlers */
    .open = [](auto *ws, auto *req) {
        ws->subscribe("buzzword weekly");
    },
    .message = [](auto *ws, std::string_view message, uWS::OpCode opCode) {
        ws->send(message, opCode);
    }
    
}).listen(9001, [](auto *token) {

    if (token) {
        std::cout << "Listening on port " << 9001 << std::endl;
    }
    
}).run();
```

I want your business to have a proper understanding of the problem before rushing in to one of the many pitfalls.

#### Excel across the board.
All that glitters is not gold. Especially so in a market driven by flashy logos, hype and pointless badges.
